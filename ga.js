/*
Genetic algorithms are randomized search algorithms that have been developed in
an effort to imitate the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics.
genetic algorithms operate on string structures, like biological structures,
which are evolving in time according to the rule of survival of the fittest
by using a randomized yet structured information exchange.
